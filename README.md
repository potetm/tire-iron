# tire-iron
Bringing the Reloaded Workflow to ClojureScript

## Motivations
1. Facilitate the [Reloaded Workflow](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/06/04/clojure-workflow-reloaded) in ClojureScript.
2. Facilitate sane, managed application startup (a la [Component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component)).
3. Provide full namespace reloading (uninstall old vars)
4. Function out of the box in every ClojureScript environment
5. Preserve application state during reloading
6. Minimize dependencies and complexity (only requires tools.namespace and a cljs REPL)

## Installation
```
[com.potetm/tire-iron "0.1.0"]
```

tire-iron should not be included in your production code (e.g.
it should be in a [leiningen profile](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/PROFILES.md)).

## Overview
tire-iron works by creating `:special-fn`s that to you add to
your ClojureScript REPL like so:

```clj
(ns my-repl
  (:require [cljs.repl :as repl]
            [cljs.repl.browser :as browser]
            [com.potetm.tire-iron :as ti]))

(repl/repl (browser/repl-env ...args)
           :special-fns (ti/special-fns :source-dirs ["src"]
                                        :state 'my-ns/my-repl-conn))
```

This installs a few functions into your REPL. The most important
of these are `refresh` and `start-watch`.

```clj
To quit, type: :cljs/quit
=> nil
(refresh)
:rebuilding
:requesting-reload (com.potetm.browser-other com.potetm.browser-client)
:ok
=> nil
```

### A note about browser REPLs
Having multiple browser REPL connections will render your system unusable.
To prevent this you should always:
1. Put your REPL connection in your `:state` var. This preserves it during namespace unloading.
2. Use `defonce` for your `:state` var. This preserves it during namespace loading.

## The Deets
`com.potetm.tire-iron/special-fns` accepts the following arguments:

```
:source-dirs - A list of strings pointing to the source directories you would like to track
:add-all? - Boolean indicating whether all namespaces should be refreshed
:before - A symbol corresponding to a zero-arg client-side function that will be called before refreshing
:after - A symbol corresponding to a zero-arg client-side function that will be called after refreshing
:state - A symbol corresponding to a client-side var that will not be unloaded
:disable-unload - A list of symbols corresponding to namespaces that should not be unloaded
:disable-reload - A list of symbols corresponding to namespaces that should not be reloaded
```

All of these values except `:source-dirs` can be overridden in the REPL by supplying 
them in the same manner to `refresh` or `start-watch`.

Since `:special-fns` are just symbols that are handled specially by the REPL,
`refresh` cannot be used as part of a script. Hence the reason why the `:before`, `:after`,
and `:state` arguments have been provided.

Refresh happens in the following order:
 1. :before is called
 2. refresh happens (the `:state` symbol is never unloaded)
 3. :after is called

`com.potetm.tire-iron/special-fns` returns a map of the following fns for use in the cljs repl.

```
'refresh         - Refreshes :source-dirs. Any passed args will override the values passed to `special-fns`.
'start-watch     - Start a watcher* that will automatically call refresh when any file under :source-dirs changes.
'stop-watch      - Stop a running watcher.
'clear           - Clear the tracker state.
'disable-unload! - Add a namespace to the disabled unload list.
'disable-reload! - Add a namespace to the disabled reload list.
'print-disabled  - See the disabled lists.
```

*NOTE: tire-iron has no access to the lifecycle of the REPL, so it cannot
automatically stop a watcher for you. Hence 'stop-watch has been provided for
you to manage it yourself. If you forget to stop a watch before you end your
REPL session, you can call the only other tire-iron API call: `com.potetm.tire-iron/stop-watch`
